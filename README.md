# Syntaxic_tree_generator

The assignment consists in the development, in NLTK a pipeline that, starting from a text in input, in a given language (English, French, German and Italian are admissible) outputs the syntactic tree of the sentence itself, intended as a tree with root in S for sentence, and leaves on the tokens labelled with a single Part-of-speech. The generation of the tree will pass through the following models:

PURE SYMBOLIC. The tree is generated by a LR analysis with CF LL2 grammar as a base. Candidates can assume the following:

- Adjectives in English and German shall be only prefixed to nouns, whilst in French and Italian are only suffixed;
- Verbs are all at present tense;
- No pronouns are admitted;
- Only one adverb is admitted, always post-poned with respect to the verb (independently of the language, and the type of adverb);
  
Overall the point above map a system that could be devised in regular expressions, but a Context-free grammar would be simpler to define. Candidate can either define a system by themselves or use a syntactic tree generation system that can be found on GitHub. Same happens for POS-tagging, where some of the above mentioned systems can be customized by existing techniques that are available in several fashions (including a pre-defined NLTK and OpenNLP libraries for POS-tagging and a module in GATE for the same purpose). Ambiguity should be blocked onto first admissible tree.
